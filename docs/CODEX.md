## Codex Overlay

This is the canonical Codex overlay used by the README install command.

1. Prefer first-class batch runs: `desloppify review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel --scan-after-import`.
2. The command writes immutable packet snapshots under `.desloppify/review_packets/holistic_packet_*.json`; use those for reproducible retries.
3. Keep reviewer input scoped to the immutable packet and the source files named in each batch.
4. If a batch fails, retry only that slice with `desloppify review --run-batches --packet <packet.json> --only-batches <idxs>`.
5. Manual override is safety-scoped: you cannot combine it with `--allow-partial`, and provisional manual scores expire on the next `scan` unless replaced by trusted internal or attested-external imports.
